# 🎴 FlashcardsDAS – Flashcard Quiz Program

## Description
**FlashcardsDAS** is a Python-based console quiz application that presents users with
 a **random set of seven (7) flashcard questions** from an Excel file.

The user will be asked if he want to play Flashcards.
The user can choose between three categories:
- 🧠 Biology
- 🏝️ Geography
- 📗 History

After completing each quiz, the program displays:
- The user’s **score**
- The **number of questions answered**

The user can then choose to continue with another category or exit the program.


## How It Works
- Questions and answers are stored in an Excel file (FlashcardsDAS.xlsx)
- A separate module (Random_question.py) selects **7 random questions** from the chosen category
- Answers are checked **case-insensitively**
- Scores and progress are displayed after each question

## Excel File Format
The Excel file **FlashcardsDAS.xlsx** contains separate sheets for each category:
- Biology
- Geography
- History1 (name it History1 because in Excel History for sheet name is reserved)

Each sheet must contain **two columns**:

| Questions | Answers |
|----------|---------|
| What is the largest organ in the human body? | skin |
| How many bones does an adult human body have? | 206 |
| Which animal has three hearts? | octopus |


## Requirements
- Python **3.8 or higher**
- Required Python libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `openpyxl`

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install pandas openpyxl
openpyxl is required because pandas uses it as an engine to read .xlsx Excel files.

## How to Run the Program
Make sure all files are in the same directory.
Run the main program:python FlashcardsDAS.py

##Example Usage:
Are you ready to play the Flashcards quiz? Enter Y or N : Y

Choose a category:
1• Biology
2• Geography
3• History
4• Exit

Choose a category (1-4): 1
You have 7 questions in Biology 🧠

Question 1: What is the largest organ in the human body?
Enter your answer: skin
✅ Correct answer.

Progress: 1/7 | Current Score: 1


## Error Handling
Invalid category numbers trigger a custom exception (InvalidCategoryError)
Non-numeric input is handled with try/except (ValueError)
Missing Excel file raises a clear error message (FileNotFoundError)

## Random Question Module
The module Random_question.py:
Reads quiz data from FlashcardsDAS.xlsx
Selects 7 random questions using DataFrame.sample()
Displays questions and checks answers
Tracks and displays score and progress
It is called from the main program using:Rq.rand_ques(sheetname)
